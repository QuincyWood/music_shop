I am interested on designing a database system for a music shop that will create an easy experience for customers looking for a certain bands, artists, albums, or songs.


There is a music shop that has customers with different taste of genres, every customer who purchases anything from the music store will be given an unique customer ID, a list of artists or bands (name, songs, prices, year) in the order of most recent purchase. Along side the customer ID, customers will give their name, and email address in case they might want to review their purchases. The data systems will also hold tickets for live events for customers whoâ€™s want to see their favorite artists.
