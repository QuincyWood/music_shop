And the customer will either purchase something from an artist or a ticket from an event.                                                                  | Since the rubric says we aren't allowed to use "has" relationships, what will your new relationship between artist and event be? Also good job.   |

| music_shop              | 1. The concept of this database is interesting. 2.Attributes are descriptive. 3. Use of primary keys in Customers and Events is good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 1. Very hard to interpret the ERD. Customers purchase artists who purchase events? 2. There is no primary key for artists although I assume its name. 3. The direction of this database does not seem clear from the ERD. Perhaps focusing on the music shop as a whole first before stepping into customer transactions and events.                                                                             | This draft does not meet the requirements of the assignment. There needs to be a much clearer flow of information from entities and thorough reconsideration of the setup of this diagram. The diagram is barebones and does not make much sense conceptually and needs to include details about the specifics of this database to fit a music store. | How could you consider how much a music store is making from sales and how the music store is operated?                                           |
